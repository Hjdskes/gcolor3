Compile from source
------------

### GNOME Builder (Recommended)

GNOME Builder is the environment used for the development of this 
application. It can use Flatpak manifests to create a consistent building
and running environment cross-distro. Thus, it is highly recommended you 
use it.

1. Download [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder).
2. In Builder, click the "Clone Repository" button at the bottom, using `git@gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3.git`
or `https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3.git` as the URL.
3. Click the build button at the top once the project is loaded.

### Manual

If you feel at home in the terminal or would like to build outside of Builder,
these are the commands to use:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gcolor3.git
cd gcolor3
meson _build
ninja -C _build
```
